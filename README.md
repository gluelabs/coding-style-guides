# Glue Labs Coding Style Guides
This repository contains Glue LabsÂ© Coding Style Guides.

Each Style Guide will be contained into a specific folder named as the language framework it applies to. 

The scope of the project is to define and document the naming conventions and coding best practice and resources to use for internal and external projects

There is no automatic deployment process for this version as it's pushed on-demand by volunteers.

This Style Guide uses [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) terminology when using the phrases *must*, *must not*, *should*, *should not*, and *may*. 

All examples given are non-normative and serve only to illustrate the normative language of the style guide.
